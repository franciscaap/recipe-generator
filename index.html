        Ingredients
        <br />2 c. balsamic vinegar <br />3 whole ripe tomatoes, sliced thick 12
        oz.<br />
        mozzarella cheese
        <br />
        Directions <br />
        1 Bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil over medium-low heat in a small
        saucepan. Cook for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the balsamic has reduced
        to a thicker glaze. Remove it from the heat and transfer to a bowl or
        cruet. Allow to cool. <br />
        2 When you're ready to serve, arrange tomato and mozzarella slices on a
        platter. Arrange basil leaves between the slices. Drizzle olive oil over
        the top of the salad, getting a little bit on each slice. Do the same
        with the balsamic reduction, making designs if you want. Store extra
        balsamic reduction in fridge for a later use.<br />
        3 End with a sprinkling of kosher salt and black pepper. Serve as a
        lunch, with crusty bread, or serve alongside a beef main course for
        dinner.
